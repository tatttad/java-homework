      if a and b corresponds for following requirements print “Both a and b legal”,
      if any of them does not correspond print about it like this “a is legal b is illegal ''. or vice versa
        1)a > 10 and b is not equal to 10
        2)both a and b is positive
        3)both a and b is negative
        4)a > 10 b < 1 both of them are odd
        5)a is a multiple of 5 OR b is a multiple of 5
        6)a is not a multiple of 5 but b is a multiple of 5
